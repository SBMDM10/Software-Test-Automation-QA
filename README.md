Final Journal For CS-320

How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

Through progressing through CS-320 I learned how testing correlates and fits into the software development lifecycle. In previous courses I created simple programs and tested
them manually by verifying output of the program and that they displayed whatever I needed to see them display. This form of manual testing is tedious and is not
as easily replicable as having code to test the program with, such as with JUnits in this course. Via using this more intelligent method of testing, along with other methods
applicable to other programming languages, I will be able to ensure my code is functional and secure within the parameters set forth for any given program.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

Interpreting user needs is typically best done following the gathering of requirements from a client, developing an understanding of who the program is for,
and then expounding upon the purpose of the project to determine what exactly a user needs to have a functional and accessible product. The intended use of a program drives a 
major portion of how a program is designed and based around the user for them to best accomplish their goals in using said program. The functionality of the program is covered 
with thorough design, development, and testing with the user needs being considered all along the way as they are as important as the program's purpose itself. Through testing
we can ascertain as to whether the understood user needs have been properly implemented.

How do I approach designing software?

I approach user needs by reading and developing a thorough understanding of the program requirements, intended purpose, end user, and how it is to be made. I then create
a design, whether it be tables and diagrams, short form notes, or any other means I have used thus far, and I try to fill in the big picture of what the program is meant to be.
Once I have created these documents, I can work towards developing the code to match my initial design. I of course find many areas where my logic needed a bit of tweaking and
I then make adjustments as necessary to best meet the program's requirements and functionalities. Through this course I got hands on experience with proper code testing and I
will be able to apply that moving forward, greatly increasing my testing speed and efficiency. Once it is all completed, I run the program as if I am an end user. Once I am
satisfied that someone else could effectively utilize my creation for their needs I consider the program complete.
This, of course, is all relevant in terms of my schooling experience thus far, but this is a foundation I will take forward and grow with as a mature in the field of programming.
